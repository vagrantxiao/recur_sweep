# recur_sweep
Description : This snippet can generate N-dimension sequence by recur_sweep()
               fucntion.
               
N: how many digits you want to sweep.

W: the weights for each digit. e.g.: 2 for binary, 10 for decimal.

weights[N]: the weights for each digit. By default, we use W.
            You can also specify your own weights.

If you specify N=2, W=2, weights[N] will be {2, 2}, and you will get

00

01

10

11


if you specify N=3, W=3, weights[N] will be {3, 3, 3}, and you will get
